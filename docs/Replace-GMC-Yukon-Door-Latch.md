### Problem:

Passenger front door on a 2007 GMC Yukon XL would not stay latched when closed. Thus making it impossible to lock the vehicle and made it unsafe to drive due to the door swinging open whenever the vehicle turned.

### Troubleshooting

1. Inspect door latch and compare against working door latch
   - Broken door latch can be manually forced open with a smart amount of pressure
   - The working door latch only opens when either the interior or exterior handle is pulled and it is not possible to force the latch open

### Steps

1. Gather vehicle data
   - Make
   - Model
   - Year
   - Trim/accessories package
   - Engine specs
   - VIN
2. Go to O'Reilly's, NAPA, or look online and price a new door latch
   - Local O'Reilly's didn't have one in stock and recommended checking with GMC dealership otherwise would have to special order it
3. Went to closest GMC dealership
   - Didn't have one in stock but located one at another dealership in town
   - Dealership #1 secured the part has on hold for me and locked in an at-cost price at Dealership #2
4. Picked up new door latch assembly from Dealership #2
5. [Remove door panel](https://youtu.be/L-qI3aVeudM) and weather barrier
6. [Discount old door latch and install new door latch](https://youtu.be/9TyTgOF67Aw)
7. Reconnect exterior door handle & test
   - Had to adjust where the exterior handle rod was connected by pressing down on the door latch connector while at the same time extending the exterior door handle
8. Reinstall weather barrier
9. Reconnect interior door handle & test
10. Reinstall door panel
11. Swing door close to engage the new latch and check for secure seal/closure
